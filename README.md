# 🌐 Rare HTML Tags Flashcard App – by Vivetha S 💖

This is a simple and interactive **flashcard-style web application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🧠 The flashcards explain **least-used and deprecated HTML tags**, such as:

- `<marquee>`
- `<blink>`
- `<strike>`
- `<wbr>`
- `<details>` and `<summary>`
- `<meter>`
- `<time>`
- `<ruby>` and `<rt>`

Each card includes:
- 🏷️ Tag name
- 🔖 Status (Deprecated or Current)
- ✍️ Description
- 💡 Example usage
- 📝 A short note or fun fact

### 🎯 Why I Made This

As a beginner web developer, I was curious about rare and forgotten HTML tags.  
So, I built this app to explore them in a fun, flip-card format.

I used **AI tools** like **Perplexity** and **ChatGPT** to help me gather, structure, and explain each tag in simple words.  
This was part of my personal learning — and now I'm sharing it for others too 🌸
